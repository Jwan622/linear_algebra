### Proof of cross product

We want to use the cross product formula and the dot product formula to then prove that the length of the cross product is related to the sin of the angle. We want to show that the length of the cross product is equal to the product of the length of both vectors and the sin of the angle between them. My notes below:

Generally speaking, the proof involves expanding out the ||a||||b||cos(theta) and the length of the cross product of two vectors squared and reducing the expansions by adding them together. We eventually add together the length of the cross product of a and b squared with the lengths of a and b times the cosine of theta. There are 3 different parts to this proof.

It makes sense. I watched this twice.
