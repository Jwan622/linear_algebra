**Sine and Cosine: Overview**

The sine (abbreviated "sin") and cosine ("cos") are the two most prominent trigonometric functions. All other trig functions can be expressed in terms of them. In fact, the sine and cosine functions are closely related and can be expressed in terms of each other.

Definition 1:
> Given any angle q (0 £ q £ 90°), we can find the sine or cosine of that angle by constructing a right triangle with one vertex of angle q. The sine is equal to the length of the side opposite to q, divided by the length of the triangle's hypotenuse. The cosine is equal to the length of the side adjacent to q, divided by the length of the triangle's hypotenuse. In this way, we can find the sine or cosine of any q in the range 0 £ q £ 90°.


Definition 1 is the simplest and most intuitive definition of the sine and cosine function. The sine definition basically says that, on a right triangle, the following measurements are related:

1. the measurement of one of the non-right angles (q)
2. the length of the side opposite to that angle
3. the length of the triangle's hypotenuse

sin(q) = opposite / hypotenuse
sin(q) = opposite / hypotenuse

This first equation says that if we evaluate the sine of that angle q, we will get the exact same value as if we divided the length of the side opposite to that angle by the length of the triangle's hypotenuse

The **main result** is this: If we know the values of any two of the above quantities involved in the sin or cosine equation, we can use the above relation to mathematically derive the third quantity. For example, the sine function allows us to answer any of the following three questions:

1. "Given a right triangle, where the measurement of one of the non-right angles (q) is known and the length of the side opposite to that angle q is known, find the length of the triangle's hypotenuse."
2. "Given a right triangle, where the measurement of one of the non-right angles (q) is known and the length of the triangle's hypotenuse is known, find the length of the side opposite to that angle q."
3. "Given a right triangle, where the length of the triangle's hypotenuse and the length of one of the triangle's other sides is known, find the measurement of the angle (q) opposite to that other side."

The cosine is similar, except that the adjacent side is used instead of the opposite side.


These relationships exist between the angle, the hypotenuse and the remaining two sides. If you know any two, you can derive the third and fourth.
