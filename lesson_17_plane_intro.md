### Plane intro

Definition of a plane:  
**Ax + By + Cz = D**   

You can say that this is an equation for a plane.

You can also give an actual point on the plane like (X0, Y0, Z0). The point is not sufficient
because you can pivot the point around the plane. But you can also specify a normal vector
to the plane like n. Say n is a normal vector which is perpendicular to the plane.

You can also find the equation for a plane if you're given a vector that is perpendicular to the plane and a point on the plane. See here in this lesson:
