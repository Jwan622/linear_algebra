### Linear independence continued

1. It is linearly dependent if the linear combination of vectors = 0 vector = (0,0). This equation is written in the notes below. Linear dependent means that one of the vectors in the set is redundant. Some of the constants need to be non-zero. (imagine two vectors going opposite directions but same magnitude. The added value of the vectors would be 0 so they would be redundant.)

2. If one of the vectors can be expressed as a combination of the other vectors.

The two are equivalent proofs for linear dependency. I show that in the images.
