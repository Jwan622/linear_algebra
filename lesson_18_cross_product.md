### Cross product

**What is it?**
1. In mathematics and vector calculus, the cross product or vector product (occasionally directed area product to emphasize the geometric significance) is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space (R3) and is denoted by the symbol ×. Given two linearly independent vectors a and b, the cross product, a × b, is a vector that is perpendicular to both and therefore normal to the plane containing them.

2. If two vectors have the same direction (or have the exact opposite direction from one another, i.e. are not linearly independent) or if either one has zero length, then their cross product is zero.
3. Note that the cross product requires both of the vectors to be three dimensional vectors.
4. The result of a dot product is a number and the result of a cross product is a vector!  Be careful not to confuse the two!

The equation for the cross product is messy. Oof. Here it is

**The cross product is orthogonal to both of the vectors that it is a cross-product of.**

In our context, the orthogonalness of the vectors is if a dot product b is equal 0. Remember orthogonal also applies to 0 vectors. The elements of the vectors can be 0.

Remember we can define a plane by two vectors. The linear combinations of the 2 2-element vectors form a plane in R^3. That makes sense.
