### Cross product

The equation for the cross product is messy. Oof. Here it is

**The cross product is orthogonal to both of the vectors that it is a cross-product of.**

In our context, the orthogonalness of the vectors is if a dot product b is equal 0. Remember orthogonal also applies to 0 vectors. The elements of the vectors can be 0.

Remember we can define a plane by two vectors. The linear combinations of the 2 2-element vectors form a plane in R^3. That makes sense.
